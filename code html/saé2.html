My hobbies are video games and cars:</br>
<h3>Video games</h3>
Video games allow me to let off steam and or make me forget things like a bad day for example
there are three that help us and still help me today to extort it also makes us meet unbelievable people.</br>
there are three games that are my favorites the first would be<strong> call of 
duty black ops 2</strong> because it's my very first real online game on which I 
played and on which I met people who have become friends ever since.</br>
the second would be <strong>apex legend </strong> because it's the game I've spent the
most time on, I've also made a lot of friends and it's also allowed 
me to keep in touch with my friends during confinement.</br>
the third is <strong>league of legend</strong>, not especially for the gameplay but more for everything
that surrounds it, such as the lore and the competitions.</br>
<h3>Car</h3>
i've been a car enthusiast since i was a kid and today i know a lot more about cars than when i was a kid,
 which is completely normal. there are three cars that make me dream, starting with the best of the three, 
 the <strong>koenigsegg jesko</strong>, then the <strong>ferrari f40</strong> and finally the<strong> ferrari sf90 stradale</strong>.</br>
