 ideas for career desired such as network administrator or cybersecurity
 engineer.</br>

<strong> Network Administrator:</strong></br>
The Network Administrator's role is to guarantee the smooth flow of
 information within the company, by managing and checking the smooth

The cybersecurity engineer is a computer security expert
 who analyzes the security flaws in a computer system and
  proposes solutions to make it more secure.</br>

I'm interested in these jobs because I really like cyber security and networking,

course, but if I have to I will.</br>

My ideal working conditions would be first of all to have a professional car if i need to move, 
then to have a secretary and to have the right to work remotely.</br>
